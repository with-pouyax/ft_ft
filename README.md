# ft_ft
This repository contains the implementation of the `ft_ft` function, designed as part of the learning exercises at the 42 school. The `ft_ft` function is a simple, yet fundamental piece of code for understanding pointers and basic value manipulation in C.

## Description

The `ft_ft` function takes as input a pointer to an integer and directly modifies the value of the integer to `42`. This operation showcases the basics of pointer usage in C programming, including dereferencing pointers to access and modify the value to which the pointer points.
